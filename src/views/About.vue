                <p>I (<a href="https://www.dillonestrada.com">Dillon Estrada</a>) created Drum Set Builder because any similar tools I've seen in the past are no longer available, and I find being able to map out a set up before actually physically putting it together to be very useful.</p>
                <p>This is a very early version of the app, so there are bound to be bugs. There are also many features that I have planned to be added in the near future.</p>
                <p>If you would like to contribute to the further development and maintenance costs of this app, you can donate with the links below. (If you can not see the links, your adblocker may be blocking them)</p>
